      "description":"Within Worldline, we want to fundamentally change how we work. As employees, we hear a lot of concepts and approaches being mentioned: Agile, Scrum, DevOps, OKRs, Value Streams, Empowered Product Teams...\n\nExperienced change agents know the risk of just using new labels for the same old ways - in other words, transformation theater. How can you tell the difference between \"the real deal\" and buzzword bingo, even if you are not an expert on the topic? And what can you do to improve the situation?\n\nThat is the goal of this talk. It will tackle:\n- What to watch out for (testing for the symptoms)\n- Getting to the sources (becoming knowledgeable)\n- Options for the next step towards (positively influencing the environment)\n\nWork life is too short to be wasted. Let's make it count!",
